      <h1>Proposed Solution for RobDroneGo</h1>
      <h2>Device Management Module:</h2>
      <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> This module will enable the registration, configuration, and monitoring of RobIseps and DroneIseps.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal Data Used:</strong> Device name, identifiers, real-time location, task history.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose and Basis:</strong> Monitoring and optimizing fleet efficiency, based on consent for non-sensitive data and legitimate interest for performing essential tasks.</p>

      <h2>Task Request Management Module:</h2>
      <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Registered users can request tasks, which are then processed and forwarded for execution.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal Data Used:</strong> User identification (name, role), request details.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose and Basis:</strong> Facilitate the operation of the service requested by users, based on the service provision contract.</p>

      <h2>Task Execution Planning Module:</h2>
      <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Advanced algorithms plan the route and sequence of task execution.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal Data Used:</strong> Location of the requested task, possibly the identifier of the requester.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose and Basis:</strong> Optimization of task execution and logistics, based on the institution's legitimate interest.</p>

      <h2>GDPR Considerations:</h2>
      <h3>Data Controller:</h3>
      <p>ISEP, as the entity that defines the purposes and means of processing personal data, will act as the data controller.</p>

      <h3>Personal Data and Processing:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>User Identification: For account creation, authentication, and association of requested tasks.</li>
        <li>Task Location: So that robots and drones can efficiently execute tasks.</li>
        <li>Surveillance Images: Used for security and may include visual personal data of individuals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Purpose and Basis of Processing:</h3>
      <p>The operational management of the fleet and task execution are based on the institution's legitimate interest in maintaining security and efficiency.</p>
      <p>For tasks involving surveillance, the basis may be the express consent of the individuals or the execution of a task in the public interest.</p>

      <h3>Data Protection and Privacy:</h3>
      <p>Data minimization must be ensured, collecting only what is necessary. Implement anonymization techniques for images collected during surveillance, especially if stored or used in demonstrations. Ensure that all users have easy access to the privacy policy and can exercise their rights under GDPR (access, rectification, deletion, opposition, limitation of processing, portability).</p>

      <h3>Security and Impact Assessment:</h3>
      <p>A data protection impact assessment (DPIA) should be carried out for significant processing operations. Technical and organizational security measures must be implemented to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data.</p>

      <h3>Solution Deployment:</h3>
      <p>Privacy by Design: From the outset, privacy should be an integrated consideration, with features that enable the protection of personal data. Staff Training: Staff should be trained in data protection practices to prevent breaches and handle data subject requests.</p>

      <h3>Operation:</h3>
      <p>Regular Monitoring: Conduct regular audits to ensure GDPR compliance. Incident Response: Have clear procedures for responding to potential personal data breaches.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
      <p>This proposed solution for RobDroneGo takes into account GDPR obligations, ensuring that the processing of personal data is carried out in a lawful, fair, and transparent manner, with respect for the rights of data subjects.</p>
